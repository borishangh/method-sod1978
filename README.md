This repo is an implementation of methods descibed in Sod's [A survey of several finite difference methods for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0021999178900232) made during my internship at CAMK in summer 2024.

## Notes
- Maccormack doesn't converge without AV
- Godunov + ACM doesn't work as expected?
- Upwind in Sod doesn't converge
- TODO: Glimm's (?)
